## Why Make this project
On the internet, the majority of existing web applications on the web are made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The reason I made this project is to get comfortable using these languages and see how they work together. I also tried using the BEM method to help organize my CSS code. Although I finished the project, my CSS is still kinda messy and a little inconsistent, but I will keep practicing to get better. Overall, the objective of this project was to see how far I've really come and to see if I could actually build something without relying on tutorials and to rely more on Google to solve issues.
